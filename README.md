The App code must include at least 1 (but can include as many as you want) of ALL of the following: Any type of Loop, An IF condition, Variable(s), An Array or List, a void or value-return Method that passes at least 1 argument, and code that performs a mathematical calculation.

The App Graphical User Interface must include at least 1 (but can include as many as you want) of ALL the following: a Form, a Button, a text box for user entry, a Label, a List Box control, and a Picture Box control.

Once you complete the development of the app you must ZIP all of your Visual Studio project files. Additionally, you must record a PowerPoint presentation which explains your app and its code. Save the PowerPoint as an .MP4 file. 

You must submit 2 deliverables: A .ZIP containing ALL of your Visual Studio Project files and the .MP4.
